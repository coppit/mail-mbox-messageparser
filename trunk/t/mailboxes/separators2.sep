Grrr. This mess makes me just plain mad.

And now Telecom has promised these new Faster&Cheaper plans to try ward 
off regulation.

I had a look at them on their website. Bah! Foo! They have increased the 
speed, haven't made it cheaper for residential customers and have left 
the data limit at the same miserable amount.

Roll on regulation I say.

Perhaps they can shove the notion of peering down the throats these greedy 
ISP's while they are at it.

Anyone know of the appropriate button to push on to encourage the 
regulators?

Ooh, where do I sign up for this fabulous 512kbps upload service?  No, 
wait, I'll stick with Telstra's measly 2Mbps for now.

Never mind.  The Commerce Commission will have it all fixed in 4 years.  I 
was sort of hoping 4 weeks or 4 months.  Has the government ever heard of a 
place called "South Korea"?  It's not even that far from here.
