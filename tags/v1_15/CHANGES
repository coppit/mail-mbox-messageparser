Version 1.15:
- Now keeps reading the first paragraph until a maximum number of bytes have
  been read. This should help people who use MUAs that add a lot of extra
  header information to the first email in a mailbox. (Thanks to Graham Gough
  <graham@cs.man.ac.uk> for pointing out the problem with VM under Emacs.)

Version 1.14:
- At installation, you no longer have to provide a full path to the external
  programs. (Thanks to Ed Avis <ed.avis@kbcfp.com> for the suggestion.)
- Fixed _print_debug_information so that it prints the values of options
  correctly. (Thanks to Jason Brunette <jbrunette@users.sourceforge.net> for
  the great bug report.)
- Fixed a file handle leak when processing non-mailbox files. (Thanks to Jason
  Brunette <jbrunette@users.sourceforge.net> for the great bug report.)

Version 1.13:
- Fixed portability issues for Windows. (It should now work under the normal
  Windows command shell.) Note that this requires the use of a temporary file
  for decompression of file handles on Windows--a minor security risk.
- Makefile.PL version detection for GNU grep now works correctly for version
  numbers which end with letters. (Thanks to David Dyck <david.dyck@fluke.com>
  for the bug report.)
- Fixed typo bugs in a couple test cases.

Version 1.12:
- Added "perl Makefile.PL" version checks for external programs like grep.
  (Suggestion by David N. Blank-Edelman <dnb@ccs.neu.edu>)
- Fixed a typo in the documented synopsis (Thanks to Christophe Nowicki
  <nowick_c@epita.fr> for the report.)
- Implemented a portable ungetc version of FileHandle, and changed this module
  to use it instead of IO::String. This will hopefully fixed the
  system-dependent bugs in the last release. (Thanks to David N.
  Blank-Edelman <dnb@ccs.neu.edu> for providing a test environment.)
- Improved compatibility with Windows. (Cygwin works, but we're still not
  there yet for Windows command shell.)
- Streamlined installation for cases where caching is not enabled in
  Mail::Mbox::MessageParser.

Version 1.11:
- Added test cases with spaces in the mailbox names. (Thanks to Johan Ekenberg
  <johan@fsdata.se> for finding the bug and submitting a partial patch.)
- Fixed line ending bugs for MS-DOS/Windows (Tests now pass under cygwin)
- Fixed mailbox detection problem with mailboxes whose first email is a
  pseudo-email used to store mailbox state information. (Thanks to Johan
  Ekenberg <johan@fsdata.se> for the bug report.)
- Fixed a bug on freebsd where mailboxes of size less than 2000 bytes would be
  incorrectly processed. (This fix is a less-than-optimal one which requires
  IO::String. I may later get the gumption to do it right using PerlIO::var)

Version 1.10:
- Testing modules are no longer (accidentally) installed.
- External programs are now queried during installation instead of just using
  whatever is in your path (a security risk). (Thanks to David N.
  Blank-Edelman <dnb@ccs.neu.edu> for the bug report.)
- Changed testing to use PERLRUN instead of FULLPERLRUN, which is not
  available with older versions of MakeMaker that ship with older versions of
  Perl. (Thanks to Ed Avis <ed.avis@kbcfp.com> for catching this.)
- Cache file permissions are now set to protect against prying eyes. (Patch by
  Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>)
- Improved speed testing.
- Added support for opening of files, and decompressing files or filehandles.
- Restructured test cases.
- Fixed a bug in _PUT_BACK_STRING which would cause major failures on Solaris.
- Fixed compatibility problems with perl 5.005_01
- Fixed grep implementation for filenames with spaces in them. (Thanks to
  Johan Ekenberg <johan@fsdata.se> for the bug report and patch.)
- Added "force_processing" option to force processing of files even if they
  look to be binary or non-mailboxes.

Version 1.00:
- Initial version, with caching and grep support. Code taken from version 5.00
  of grepmail
