A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day. He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. April is the cruellest month Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me Flies never visit an egg that has no crack  You can throw a cat however you want; it always lands on its feet  
A Good Tongue is a Good Weapon. A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good. 
Hard work never did anyone any harm  Still waters run deep They that dance must pay the fiddler Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger.

 A friend in need is a friend indeed. Promises are like babies Easy to make, hard to deliver He knows best what good is that has endured evil  Sex takes up the least amount of time and causes the most amount of trouble  Man strength deh ah he hand, woman strength deh a she mouth. Rain, Rain, go away, come back another day

Hi,

I know we all laugh about the windows blue screen of death, but to be
fair, when Linux oops, it is not even able to display anything on the
screen, unless in dump terminal mode. I.e. Not X or some other GUI.

Are there any plans to implement a sort of interactive system management
mode, that would pop up a window when Linux oops. Something like the
program called SoftICE for windows would be a nice addition to Linux,
and help with kernel development.

For those who don't know what SoftICE does, when windows wishes to
display a blue screen of death (BSOD), SoftICE pops up a window showing
a disassembly of the point where the crash happened, and allows users to
type commands on the keyboard that will display extra information.
SoftICE also has a hot key, so the user can cause it to pop up at any
time they wish. During the pop-up, the entire OS is halted, and the only
commands possible are within the pop-up window. Another command exits
the pop-up and returns control to the OS.

I imagine that this feature would be tightly linked with the work
currently being done to unite all the different video drivers.
Unfortunately, I think work could take a long time. For example, on my
nvidia based card, even the kernel frame buffer drivers either fail to
display anything, or fail to scroll up the screen when a new printk happens.

I am not attending the KS this year, but I do hope that all the
interested parties can use a BOF session to come to some agreement on
the way forward, I would then be able to make useful contributions to at
least get my system working with whatever new model is decided on.

James

Alan correctly surmised this was due to a VIA motherboard bug and moving
the gigabit card to a different slot solved the problem without the need
for noapic or irqpoll. The issue turned up with other network cards (e.g.
a tuplip and an 8139) so it was fairly clear the issue wasn't driver
related.

Just for the record the motherboard in question is a Gigabyte GA-7DX+,
host bridge is a AMD-760 [IGD4-1P], ISA bridge is a VIA VT82C686 [Apollo
Super South] (rev 40)). At least two of the slots in the machine are
"cursed".
