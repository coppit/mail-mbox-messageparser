Although there is the HEXMON program, I too, have been trying to do what
you describe, and encountered the same problems. I found it to be a
timing issue, and, through trial and error, have a found some settings
that seem to work most of the time.

My goal was to make C code that looked the same when compiled and run on
the Host is the code that ran under IC. 

I am including the host and HB programs here. If anyone knows of a
better way of communicating, please let us know.
