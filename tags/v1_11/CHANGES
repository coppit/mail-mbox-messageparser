Version 1.11:
- Added test cases with spaces in the mailbox names. (Thanks to Johan Ekenberg
  <johan@fsdata.se> for finding the bug and submitting a partial patch.)
- Fixed line ending bugs for MS-DOS/Windows (Tests now pass under cygwin)
- Fixed mailbox detection problem with mailboxes whose first email is a
  pseudo-email used to store mailbox state information. (Thanks to Johan
  Ekenberg <johan@fsdata.se> for the bug report.)
- Fixed a bug on freebsd where mailboxes of size less than 2000 bytes would be
  incorrectly processed. (This fix is a less-than-optimal one which requires
  IO::String. I may later get the gumption to do it right using PerlIO::var)

Version 1.10:
- Testing modules are no longer (accidentally) installed.
- External programs are now queried during installation instead of just using
  whatever is in your path (a security risk). (Thanks to David N.
  Blank-Edelman <dnb@ccs.neu.edu> for the bug report.)
- Changed testing to use PERLRUN instead of FULLPERLRUN, which is not
  available with older versions of MakeMaker that ship with older versions of
  Perl. (Thanks to Ed Avis <ed.avis@kbcfp.com> for catching this.)
- Cache file permissions are now set to protect against prying eyes. (Patch by
  Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>)
- Improved speed testing.
- Added support for opening of files, and decompressing files or filehandles.
- Restructured test cases.
- Fixed a bug in _PUT_BACK_STRING which would cause major failures on Solaris.
- Fixed compatibility problems with perl 5.005_01
- Fixed grep implementation for filenames with spaces in them. (Thanks to
  Johan Ekenberg <johan@fsdata.se> for the bug report and patch.)
- Added "force_processing" option to force processing of files even if they
  look to be binary or non-mailboxes.

Version 1.00:
- Initial version, with caching and grep support. Code taken from version 5.00
  of grepmail
