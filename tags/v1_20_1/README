Mail::Mbox::MessageParser - A fast and simple mbox folder reader

Mail::Mbox::MessageParser is a feature-poor but very fast mbox parser. It uses
the best of three strategies for parsing a mailbox: either using cached folder
information, GNU grep, or highly optimized Perl.


NEW IN THIS VERSION

Version 1.21.0: Wed Sep 15 2004
- Fixed missing file warnings from "make distcheck" resulting from a
  workaround for a MakeMaker bug.
- Dropped force_processing in M::M::Grep (all files treated as text), since
  M::MessageParser detects file types. This fixes a Perl warning issued when
  force_processing is false and M::MessageParser determines that the file is
  text, but it contains a binary character. 
- Updated Makefile.PL to use Module::Install


MODULE DEPENDENCIES

To use this module, you will need to install:

- FileHandle::Unget
- Storable: required if you want to use caching
- GNU grep(1): required if you want to use grep support
- bzip2(1): required if you want to use bzip and bzip2 support
- bzip(1): required if you want to use bzip support
- tzip(1): required if you want to use tzip support

You should be prompted to install modules automatically when you run "perl
Makefile.PL".


INSTALLATION

To install this package, change to the directory where you unarchived this
distribution and type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

You will be prompted for installation locations and program locations. You can
suppress these prompts by specifying:

- either "PREFIX=/installation/path" (for installation into a custom
  location), "INSTALLDIRS=site" (for installation into site-specific Perl
  directories), or "INSTALLDIRS=perl" (for installation into standard Perl
  directories).
- the path to one or more external programs. For example, "GREP=/gnu/bin/grep
  TZIP= GZIP=/gnu/bin/gzip BZIP=/bin/bzip2 BZIP2=/bin/bzip2" would set values
  for all but one program. "TZIP=" disables compression support and prevents
  interactive execution. (NOTE: These values are not validated as they are in
  the interactive query.)

If you make the installation into your own directory, then remember that you
must tell perl where to search for modules before trying to 'use' them. For
example:

  use lib '/home/userid/lib';
  use CGI::Cache;

If make test fails, please see the INSTALLATION PROBLEMS section below.


INSTALLATION PROBLEMS

If "make test" fails, run

  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

and see which test(s) are failing. Please email, to the address below, the
*.testoutput and *.testoutput.diff files for the test, which are located in
t/temp.

For other bugs, see the section REPORTING BUGS below.


DOCUMENTATION

Just "perldoc Mail::Mbox::MessageParser". After installation on Unix systems,
you can also do "man Mail::Mbox::MessageParser". If you are interested in the
Cache, Grep, or Perl implementations, you can do the same for
Mail::Mbox::MessageParser::Cache, Mail::Mbox::MessageParser::Grep. and
Mail::Mbox::MessageParser::Perl

REPORTING BUGS

You can report bugs by filing a bug report at the project homepage. Please
attach the output files noted above. If the bug is related to processing of a
particular mailbox, try to trim the mailbox to the smallest set of emails that
still exhibit the problem.  Then use the "anonymize_mailbox" program that
comes with the distribution to remove any sensitive information, and attach
the mailbox to the bug report.
