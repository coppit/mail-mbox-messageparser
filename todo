- Add compression support to grep
- Add random access (email Tassilo von Parseval
  <tassilo.parseval@post.rwth-aachen.de>)
- Cache, Cache::Cache
- When the subclasses call read_next_email, shouldn't the entry be validated?
- Version the cache file, so that we can invalidate it if a release of the
  module fixes a bug.
- As it is now, if we re-initialize the cache, we start all caching over. Fix
  this so that we can use partial cache information. See MetaInfo.pm
