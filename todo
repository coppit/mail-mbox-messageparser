- Detect mix of dos and unix line endings and fail with an error
- Tolerate a mix of dos and unix line endings
- read_until_match() is slow when it has to read more data, because it
  restarts the search at the top of the buffer, leading to exponential
  slowdown
- The above 3 issues were observed while investigating an email from
  Pali Roh√°r <pali.rohar@gmail.com>

- Wrong assumption parsing Multipart/Mixed messages

- Module misidentifies a mbox-file as binary

- Add compression support to grep
- Add random access (email Tassilo von Parseval

- Cache, Cache::Cache
- When the subclasses call read_next_email, shouldn't the entry be validated?
- Version the cache file, so that we can invalidate it if a release of the
  module fixes a bug.
- As it is now, if we re-initialize the cache, we start all caching over. Fix
  this so that we can use partial cache information. See MetaInfo.pm
