Mail::Mbox::MessageParser - A fast and simple mbox folder reader

Mail::Mbox::MessageParser is a feature-poor but very fast mbox parser. It uses
the best of three strategies for parsing a mailbox: either using cached folder
information, GNU grep, or highly optimized Perl.

Version 1.20:
- More robust use of GNU grep to find emails on DOS systems
- Fixed an uninitialized value warning in Cache.pm
- Made everything work with DOS-style line endings. Added endline() function
  to return the detected line ending


DEPENDENCIES

- FileHandle::Unget
- Storable: required if you want to use caching
- GNU grep(1): required if you want to use grep support
- bzip2(1): required if you want to use bzip and bzip2 support
- bzip(1): required if you want to use bzip support
- tzip(1): required if you want to use tzip support

The modules can be found here:

Storable:                http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Storable
FileHandle::Unget:       http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=FileHandle-Unget

Installation can also be done automatically using the CPAN module:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Storable'
  perl -MCPAN -e 'install FileHandle::Unget'


INSTALLATION

=> On Non-Windows systems:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

The "perl Makefile.PL" command will prompt you for an installation location if
you run it interactively, and will use the default values if it is run
non-iteractively. You will be asked to select the locations of certain
external compression programs.

You can force it to run non-interactively by specifying each of the following:

- either "PREFIX=/installation/path" (for installation into a custom
  location), "INSTALLDIRS=site" (for installation into site-specific Perl
  directories), or "INSTALLDIRS=perl" (for installation into standard Perl
  directories).
- the path to one or more external programs. For example,
  "GREP=/gnu/bin/grep TZIP= GZIP=/gnu/bin/gzip BZIP=/bin/bzip2 BZIP2=/bin/bzip2"
  would set values for all but one program. "TZIP=" disables compression
  support and prevents interactive execution. (NOTE: These values are not
  validated as they are in the interactive query.)

If make test fails, please see the INSTALLATION PROBLEMS section below.


INSTALLATION PROBLEMS

If "make test" fails, run

  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

and see which test(s) are failing. Please email, to the address below, the
*.testoutput and *.testoutput.diff files for the test, which are located in
t/temp.

For other bugs, see the section REPORTING BUGS below.


DOCUMENTATION

Just "perldoc Mail::Mbox::MessageParser". After installation on Unix systems,
you can also do "man Mail::Mbox::MessageParser". If you are interested in the
Cache, Grep, or Perl implementations, you can do the same for
Mail::Mbox::MessageParser::Cache, Mail::Mbox::MessageParser::Grep. and
Mail::Mbox::MessageParser::Perl

REPORTING BUGS

You can report bugs by filing a bug report at the project homepage. Please
attach the output files noted above. If the bug is related to processing of a
particular mailbox, try to trim the mailbox to the smallest set of emails that
still exhibit the problem.  Then use the "anonymize_mailbox" program that
comes with the distribution to remove any sensitive information, and attach
the mailbox to the bug report.
