Mail::Mbox::MessageParser - A fast and simple mbox folder reader

Mail::Mbox::MessageParser is a feature-poor but very fast mbox parser. It uses
the best of two strategies for parsing a mailbox: either using cached folder
information or highly optimized Perl.


MODULE DEPENDENCIES

To use this module, you will need to install:

- FileHandle::Unget
- Storable: required if you want to use caching
- bzip2(1): required if you want to use bzip and bzip2 support
- bzip(1): required if you want to use bzip support

To test this module, you will need to install:

- Test::More


INSTALLATION

To install this package, change to the directory where you unarchived this
distribution and type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

You can install this package into a non-default location by appending one of
the following to the "perl Makefile.PL" command:

- "PREFIX=/installation/path" (for installation into a custom location),
- "INSTALLDIRS=site" (for installation into site-specific Perl directories)
- "INSTALLDIRS=perl" (for installation into standard Perl directories).

You will be prompted for program locations. You can suppress these prompts by
appending the path to one or more external programs to the "perl Makefile.PL"
command. For example, "GZIP=/gnu/bin/gzip BZIP= BZIP2=/bin/bzip2" would set
values for all but one program.  "BZIP=" disables compression support and
prevents interactive execution.  (NOTE: These values are not validated as they
are in the interactive query.)

If you make the installation into your own directory, then remember that you
must tell perl where to search for modules before trying to 'use' them. For
example:

  use lib '/home/userid/lib';
  use Mail::Mbox::MessageParser;

If make test fails, please see the INSTALLATION PROBLEMS section below.


INSTALLATION PROBLEMS

If "make test" fails, run

  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

and see which test(s) are failing. Please email, to the address below, the
*.testoutput and *.testoutput.diff files for the test.

For other bugs, see the section REPORTING BUGS below.


DOCUMENTATION

Just "perldoc Mail::Mbox::MessageParser". After installation on Unix systems,
you can also do "man Mail::Mbox::MessageParser". If you are interested in the
Cache, or Perl implementations, you can do the same for
Mail::Mbox::MessageParser::Cache and Mail::Mbox::MessageParser::Perl.

When reporting a bug, please attach the output files noted above. If the bug
is related to processing of a particular mailbox, try to trim the mailbox to
the smallest set of emails that still exhibit the problem.  Then use the
"anonymize_mailbox" program that comes with the distribution to remove any
sensitive information, and attach the mailbox to the bug report.
