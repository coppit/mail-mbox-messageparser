- Detect mix of dos and unix line endings and fail with an error
- Tolerate a mix of dos and unix line endings
- read_until_match() is slow when it has to read more data, because it
  restarts the search at the top of the buffer, leading to exponential

  this so that we can use partial cache information. See MetaInfo.pm
